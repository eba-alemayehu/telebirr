## Platform Authentication Rule

1. Telebirr platform allocate appId and appKey to the corresponding third party client. Each third party will have a
   unique appId and appKey.
2. Third party source IP addresses should be added on the trust list. Those IP addresses of clients that are not in the
   trust list will not access telebirr system.
3. The time of the timestamp is consistent with that of the server (within one minute). If they are inconsistent, the
   access is considered illegal.
4. Check whether the signature entered by the client is consistent with the signature generated by the system. If they
   are inconsistent, the access is considered illegal.

telebirr = Telebirr(
    app_id="YOUR APP ID FROM TELEBIRR ADMIN",
    app_key="YOUR APP KEY FROM TELEBIRR ADMIN",

```python
from telebirr import Telebirr
public_key = "YOUR PUBLIC KEY FORM TELEBIRR ADMIN"
payload = "Payload coming from telebirr" // If you are using django it means request.body

decrypted_data = Telebirr.decrypt(public_key=public_key, payload=payload)
// Do what every you need to do with your data eg: update your order status
